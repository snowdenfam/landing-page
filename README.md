Alright so I am looking at the picture provided to create this website. 

Questions:

Right off the bat I have a question on how do I create a continuous web page where the pages are divided up. Or is that just one long web page?

How should I attack this project? Page by page? Start with the first page and then go down from there? I think I will go page by page. 

Challenges:

It actually looks pretty simple in the way that its made up and i'm excited to finish this and start javascript. I think I will need some more help with making all the items fit evenly with using containers and flex box. 

The first page has a modal on it which is on the left side and then an image that takes up about the same amount of space on the right side. How do I put both of those together? Do I make a container for both the modal and the image or make seperate containers?

I cant really remember how to make cards and have them spaced evenly. I have some idea through using flex box and containers but well see. I will need to do some research on this for the second page of this website.
